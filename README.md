# Gearlist

![Gearlist](social-preview.png)

A source-checked stack of agent tools, MCP servers and skills. Each entry says what it is, who it is for, and the access it needs, so a person can scan it and an agent can load it.

By Tech Horizon Labs. This edition contains 25 entries. Documentation checked means the source was read. It does not mean the software was installed, tested or security audited. Entries are grouped by purpose, in no particular order.

## How to use this

- Human: scan the groups below. The heading is the product. **For** is the audience. **Access and use** is the permission note.
- Agent: load [llms.txt](llms.txt) first, then [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt) or [resources.json](resources.json). [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the house rules. Do not install from a row until a human authorises it.

Install the catalog skill with:

```bash
npx skills add techhorizonlabs/gearlist
```

Gearlist is a checked shortlist with permission notes. For every public MCP server, use the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io). All 313 repositories we've starred on GitHub are stored in [stars-queue.json](stars-queue.json). Official Claude Code plugins are listed in [indexes/claude-plugins-official.json](indexes/claude-plugins-official.json). Queued rows wait until someone reads their docs. A star or a marketplace listing is not an entry.
